# Home-Automation-Using-Embedded-Systems.
Intelligent home automation system to operate or manipulate the electrical machines using an outstanding technology which is bluetooth. Throwback everyone felt anxious and perilous towards the home appliances switching to overcome these complications, in past days we had ample technologies are came into the market like person detector sensor, remote operation and clap to on the appliances etc. even though the lot of members are felt atrocious towards the operation of home appliances to mitigate all those issues, we came up with an outstanding technology at present the world is being like an instant work and instant output and comes to our project is voice controlling home automation system using Bluetooth technology through this application we should sound off commands like TV is on or TV is off likewise all the appliances using 8051 family microcontroller. Bluetooth modules are more reliable, secure and low power modules and these modules do not require line of sight also. We can use mobile Bluetooth by developing some applications or we can use normal USB Bluetooth dongles by connecting to PC.
